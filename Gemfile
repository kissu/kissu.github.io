# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
gem "jekyll", "~> 3.6.0"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
# gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
  # for some reason, livereload is not working if installed as a "plugin" in the
  # config.yml file so I generated a gemfile for it
  gem 'jekyll-livereload'
  gem 'jekyll-font-awesome-sass'
  gem 'jekyll-analytics'
end
