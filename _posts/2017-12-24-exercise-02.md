# Challenge 2, Clock
The goal is to make a nice looking clock. :clock1:

Nothing to add about that challenge, expected to learn something more that just
how to make a radius transform each second. Exercice is pretty much to design
the hands properly and fix the `0`'s _bug_.

### Minor stuff I learned
```js
var date = new Date()
var hours = date.getHours()
```

+ code to get the current hour

`transform-origin: 100%;` was used to center the hand of the clock in the
midddle

### Some ideas to add to the project

* [ ] make the whole project from scratch (easier positionning for the hands...)
* [ ] resolve the tricky issue of the transition when a hand hits 0
  hours/minutes/seconds
* [x] worth it ? not really.
